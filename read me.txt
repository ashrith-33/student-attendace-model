Person Detection System with Logging and Unknown Capture
This project is a simple ML tool for real-time person detection. It uses facial recognition to identify people, log their entry, and capture pictures of unknown visitors.

Key Features
Person Recognition: Detects known people from a webcam, video, or image.

Access Log: Keeps a log of when known people are detected.

Unknown Capture: Saves pictures of anyone not in the system's database.

Configurable: Easily switch between different camera inputs and adjust settings.

Setup
You need Python 3.6 or newer. Install the required libraries with this command:

pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy

Note: On Windows, you might need to install Visual Studio Build Tools to get face_recognition working.

Project Files
Your project folder should look like this:

project_folder/
├── dataset/                
│   ├── Ashrith/
│   └── John_Doe/
├── logs/                 
├── unknown_captures/       
├── trained_faces.pkl       
├── train.py                
└── detect.py               

How to Use
Step 1: Add Photos
Create a dataset folder.

Make a folder inside for each person you want to recognize (e.g., Ashrith).

Put their photos in their respective folders.

Step 2: Train the System
This creates the trained_faces.pkl file from your photos.

Open your terminal in the project folder.

Run the training script:

python train.py

Step 3: Run Detection
This runs the real-time detection based on your settings.

Open detect.py in a text editor.

In the "Configuration" section, uncomment the line for the input you want to use (webcam, image, or video). For images and videos, also set the file path.

Save the file and run it from your terminal:

python detect.py

Tips:

To Quit: Click the OpenCV window and press the 'q' key.

For Speed: To make the video smoother, increase the FRAME_SKIP_INTERVAL in detect.py.
